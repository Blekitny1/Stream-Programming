I have done these projects on Stream Programming course during my Big Data Analytics studies. Files named "SP lab ..." are files with codes in Scala 2 with their sample executions through command prompt. Remaining files are independent scala programs that are pasted there for sake of completeness. Outline of the course and problems solved:
1. Introduction to Scala programming language
2. Basic statistics of stream
3. Hash tables and Bloom filters
4. Error correctiong codes
5. Counting distincts elements in stream
6. Estimating moments of stream

Algorithms considered for solving these problems:
1. HyperLogLog algorithm
2. Bloom filter 
3. Count-min algorithm
4. Majority algorithm
5. Misra-Gries summary
6. Hamming (7,4) code
